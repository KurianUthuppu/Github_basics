# Github_basics
_Capturing the basics of Github including setup and sync_


### Basic requirements
* Git
  - Download Git from this link https://git-scm.com/downloads and install as per the guidelines

### Resources
* Useful youtube video from freeCodeCamp.org - https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk

### Setting up your account in Github
- This is relatively simple and straightforward once you arrive at https://github.com/
- You may either refer to the above youtube video or use this link https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account for further guidance

### Setting up your profile
- Select 'Your Profile' in the menu that pops up after clicking the top-right corner profile image
- Add relevant details along with a 'dashing photo' of yours! :wink:

### Cheat code for creating profile page
(Ref: https://aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme/)
* Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username
* Create a README.md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)
* Commit your fancy new README!
  - If you're on GitHub's web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo's main branch (i.e., master or main) which will make it immediately visible on your profile)
  - Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i.e., on your computer and not github.com)
